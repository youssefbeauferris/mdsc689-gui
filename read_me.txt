The following code is an interactive tool which enables user interaction for augmenting MR data. 

There are still many bugs in this code which need to be worked out. So please report those that are found. 

To use the tool:

1) load data 
2) adjust zSlice
3) draw by holding the left mouse button and dragging slowly.
4) press save lesion opening up a figure to determine if the contour has closed.5) if i has not try to add nodes or draw again.
6) once you have created a closed contour, press add lesion and you are set. 

The cropping tool is still in development. 
Adjustments to lesion brightness do not consistently work.
